## GeomAlgorithms

http://geomalgorithms.com/code.html

The purpose of this site is to provide practical geometric algorithms for the software developer. That is, algorithms that are:

* Relevant - they solve significant geometric problems for real world applications
* Correct - they give accurate solutions for the problems
* Robust - they tolerate small numerical errors and avoid overflow within constraints
* Efficient - they are fast in practice for typical applications, both small and large
* Conservative - they use few resources, such as storage space
* Maintainable - they are straightforward to implement and troubleshoot
* Elegant - one can understand why they work, which gives confidence in their use.

## Expat XML Parser

http://expat.sourceforge.net/

Expat is an XML parser library written in C. It is a stream-oriented parser in which an application registers handlers for things the parser might find in the XML document (like start tags).


## SBJson

http://www.superloopy.io/json-framework/

SBJson’s number one feature is chunk-based operation. Feed the parser one or more chunks of UTF8-encoded data and it will call a block you provide with each root-level document or array. Or, optionally, for each top-level entry in each root-level array. 


## OpenSSL

## Reachability.h

https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/

Basic demonstration of how to use the SystemConfiguration Reachablity APIs.


## MoveMe

https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/MoveMe/Introduction/Intro.html

This application illustrates simple drawing, touch handling, and animation using UIKit and Core Animation.

A touch inside a placard animates it in two ways: Its transform is changed such that it appears to pulse, and it is moved such that its center is directly under the touch.

A drag moves the placard so that it remains centered under the touch. When the touch ends, the placard is animated back to the center of the screen, and its original (identity) transform restored.


## route-me
